The folders "Continental China" and "Sub-Saharan Africa" both contain data calculated on the basis of 50×50 km2 and 100×100 km2 grid cells,
i.e., the folders "grid cell size_50km" and "grid cell size_100km", both of which contain:

  1. The folder "landscape metrics", containing a series of CSV files:

     Taking two examples to illustrate the naming rule:
       "lm_1km_context10km" refers to landscape metrics of landscape context at the scale of 10 km, calculated based on landcover data with the resolution of 1 km;
       "lm_1km_local" refers to landscape metrics of local landscape, calculated based on landcover data with the resolution of 1 km.   

     In each CSV file:
       The first column "Id" refers to ID of each landscape, 
       other columns refer to landscape metrics (see Table 2 in the maintext for description of each metric), including metrics at class and landscape level:
         Class level: 
           1 - Forests, 2 - Croplands, 3 - Grassland/Shrublands, 4 - Bare/Urban land, 5 - Water bodies.
         Landscape level:
           All


  2. macro-environmental variables.csv:

     macro-environmental variables within grid cells. See Table S2 in supporting information for description of each variable.  


  3. species richness.csv:

     species richness of all mammals and species groups according to body size (small, medium and large) and diet (herbivore, carnivore and omnivore) within grid cells.


Also, the folders "Continental China" and "Sub-Saharan Africa" both contain:

  1. geographic coordinates.xlsx:

     geographic coordinates of centroids of grid cells.


  2. species list.xlsx:

     species name, and body size group and trophic gulid they belong to.
